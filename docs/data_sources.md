# Data Sources

## Sentinel-5P / TROPOMI CH4
- Purpose: daily coarse-resolution hotspot candidate generation.
- Access: open/public datasets.
- MVP use: anomaly-based hotspot extraction + persistence signals.

## NASA EMIT Methane Plumes
- Purpose: high-resolution confirmation events where coverage overlaps candidates.
- Access: open/public products.
- MVP use: confirmation overlay and emitter evidence enrichment.

## Notes
- QA filtering is mandatory and configurable.
- Preserve traceability metadata for dataset/product/time/AOI/thresholds.
