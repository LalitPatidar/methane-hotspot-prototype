# Specs-Driven Development Pack

This folder defines a specs-driven workflow for delivering the methane hotspot MVP from the current scaffold to production-ready behavior.

## Documents

1. `current_state_analysis.md`
   - Snapshot of what is already implemented.
   - Gap analysis against MVP success criteria.

2. `mvp_system_spec.md`
   - End-to-end product/system requirements for the MVP.
   - Acceptance criteria organized by API, pipeline, and UI capabilities.

3. `implementation_roadmap.md`
   - Milestones, sequencing, dependencies, and definition-of-done for each phase.

4. `spec_workflow.md`
   - Day-to-day spec process (how to write and execute specs before coding).
   - Templates for feature specs and executable task checklists.

## How to use

- Start each new feature by creating a short feature spec based on `spec_workflow.md`.
- Verify the feature maps to at least one requirement in `mvp_system_spec.md`.
- Ensure milestone alignment using `implementation_roadmap.md`.
- Keep `current_state_analysis.md` updated as capabilities land.
